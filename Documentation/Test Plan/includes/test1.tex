\section{Test tables}
Explanation: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Target on screen\\
	The actual screen commands the user will interact with.
	\item Test Data/Simulation\\
	Test actions under different kinds of conditions and with different kinds of data to check if we have captured all the exceptions and if we take necessary prcautions to prevent the action from crashing.
	\item Rusult\\
	What is the result in each different case we ran the test.
